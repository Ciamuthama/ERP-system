# Dashboard Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

The Dashboard project is a modern web application built using Next.js. It includes reusable UI components such as forms, dialogs, drawers, and sheets, designed to provide a seamless user experience. The project is optimized for performance and scalability.

## Features

- **Reusable UI Components**: Includes components like `Form`, `Dialog`, `Drawer`, and `Sheet` for building interactive interfaces.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Supports both static and dynamic rendering with Next.js.
- **Optimized for Deployment**: Easily deployable on platforms like Vercel.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciamutham/ERP-system
cd ERP-system
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
